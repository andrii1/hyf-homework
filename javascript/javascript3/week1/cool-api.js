COOL API

https://api.agify.io/

The Agify API is a fun API that tries to predict your age from your name. You donâ€™t need an API key to get started, so you can just send a request with your name in it to find out how old their algorithm thinks you are.

For example,
https://api.agify.io/?name=george

returns an OBJECT with name you have entered, your predicted age and count, which is possibly how many times it was called.

{
"name": "george",
"age": 24,
"count": 57677
}

https://api.agify.io/?name=jason

returns

{
"name": "jason",
"age": 53,
"count": 62634
}
